Battleship

What is it?

This program is a python 2.7.2 simulation of the classic board game called "Battleship".

Why?

To practic python, to learn using git, to learn how to do unit testing.

I'm still very new to python and completely new to unit testing as well as VCS so this is my training ground. Because of the nature of this project I won't accept any commits, however any pointers are more than welcome.
